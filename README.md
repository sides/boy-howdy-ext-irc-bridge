Quick extension for [Boy Howdy](https://github.com/sides/boy-howdy) done for a friend and semi as proof-of-concept. Syncs a Discord channel with an IRC channel. It's single-user on Discord's side, meaning the bot on Discord does not prefix messages with the irc nick, but instead is implied they are coming from the same single user.
